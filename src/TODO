# Are we blogging yet

[ ] generate the index(?) list/links
[~] generate the blog post html
[ ] generate the blog post 
    [ ] vanity urls
    [ ] title (h1 / title tag)
    [ ] keywords
    [ ] publication datetime
[ ] generate the rss (index.xml)
[ ] generate the sitemap.xml
[ ] 404s


regarding the vanity urls and tags, we could use the filename... like hugo does

e.g. configure-vscode-debug-clang-breakpoints-apple-silicon
becomes /posts/configure-vscode-debug-clang-breakpoints-apple-silicon

tags would become configure, vscode, debug, clang, breakpoints, apple, silicon

so then the only thing that remains is the title tag, which has to be extracted from the first H1(?)

try this though

<title>Hello World</title>
<meta name="description" content="The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.">
<meta name="author" content="John Smith">

## Heading
Markdown content begins here

Actually, we can use the publication date as part of the vanity url
    
    2023-05-29-configure-vscode-debug-clang-breakpoints-apple-silicon/whatever.md

or even better, since we're going to write index.html anyway, use the filename.md as the publication date

    configure-vscode-debug-clang-breakpoints-apple-silicon/2023-05-29.md

the only problem is sorting. If we want to get them in order, it's better to include a US formatted date in the vanity url. We could do it both ways, maybe.

    2023-05-29_configure-vscode-debug-clang-breakpoints-apple-silicon/.md
             ^^^ note the separator being different from the typical -

we can extract the date and the vanity url from this, as well as the keywords.
that leaves us the title ... "Configure Visual Studio Code on macOS to get breakpoints on Apple Silicon (M1/M2)"
